    For our next trick, we'll use Django's standard user creation form, the one used by admin application
    to create a new user. With this 2 things are resolve:

    * Validation of uniqueness of the username.
    * Password creation, that includes confirmation of the password and if the password is safe.

    Also, extending standard form to request email, first and last name from the get-go, instead of re-creating Django's
    admin site's flow.
